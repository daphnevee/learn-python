Python 3 program to calculate Normal Distribution

Task: The final grades for a Physics exam taken by a large group
of students have a mean of Î¼ = 70 and a standard deviation of Ïƒ = 10.
If we can approximate the distribution of these grades by a normal
distribution, what percentage of the students:
1. Scored higher than 80 (i.e., have a grade > 80)?
2. Passed the test (i.e., have a grade >= 60)?
3. Failed the test (i.e., have a grade < 60)?

Find and print the answer to each question on a new line, rounded to
a scale of 2 decimal places.

Sample input: 
mean = 70
std = 10
high_score = 80
passing_score = 60

Expected output:
Probability for Event A: 15.87
Probability for Event B: 84.13
Probability for Event C: 15.87
