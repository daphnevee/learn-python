Manual Solution to calculate Conditional Probability and Combinations and Permutations

Task: A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are
drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn
is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Choices:
a. 1/12
b. 1/6
c. 7/12
d. 2/3 -- Answer

Solution:
Event A -> the 2nd marble is blue
P(A) = 4/6 = 2/3

Explanation: Since the first marble chosen is already red, the bag contains 6 remaining
marbles. The second marble must be blue and there are still 4 blue marbles in the bag.
