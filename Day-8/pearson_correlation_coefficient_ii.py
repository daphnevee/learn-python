Manual solution to calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient

Task: The regression line of y on x is 3x + 4y + 8 = 0, and the
regression line of x on y is 4x + 3y + 7 = 0. What is the value
of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

Choices:
a. 1
b. -1
c. 3/4
d. -4/3
e. 4/3
f. -3/4 -- Answer

Solution:
Equation 1: 3x + 4y + 8 = 0
4y = -3x - 8
y = -3/4x - 8/4
y = -3/4x - 2
byx = -3/4 or -0.75

Equation 2: 4x + 3y + 7 = 0
4x = -3y - 7
x = -3/4y - 7/4
bxy = -3/4 or -0.75

r = (+/-)sqrt(byx * bxy) = (+/-)sqrt(-3/4 * -3/4) = -3/4 or -0.75
